# IQA-Adapter
Code for the paper "IQA-Adapter: Exploring Knowledge Transfer from Image Quality Assessment to Diffusion-based Generative Models"

*TLDR*: IQA-Adapter is a tool that combines Image Quality/Aesthetics Assessment (IQA/IAA) models with image-generation and enables quality-aware generation with diffusion-based models. It allows to condition image generators on target quality/aesthetics scores.

TODO list:
- [ ] Release code for IQA-Adapter inference and training for SDXL base model
- [ ] Release weights for IQA-Adapters trained with different IQA/IAA models
- [ ] Create project page
- [ ] Release code for experiments


Demonstration of guidance on quality (y-axis) and aesthetics (x-axis) scores:
